# This example shows how to use a single dynamic demuxer branch with a 
# multi-source Pipeline. The Pipeline trunk consists of:
#   - 5 Streaming Images Sources - each streams a single image at a given 
#       frame-rate with a number overlayed representing the stream-id.
#   - The Pipeline's built-in streammuxer muxes the streams into a
#       batched stream as input to the Inference Engine.
#   - Primary GST Inference Engine (PGIE).
#   - IOU Tracker.
#
# The dynamic branch will consist of:
#   - On-Screen Display (OSD)
#   - Window Sink - with window-delete and key-release event handlers.
# 
# The branch is added to one of the Streams when the Pipeline is constructed
# by calling:
#
#    dsl_tee_demuxer_branch_add_to('demuxer', 'branch-0', stream_id)
#
# Once the Pipeline is playing, the example uses a simple periodic timer to 
# call a callback function which advances/cycles the current stream_id 
# variable and moves the branch by calling.
#
