![DeepStream Services Library](/Images/dsl-github-banner.png)

## Intelligent Audio and Video Analytics (IAVA)
A library of on-demand DeepStream Pipeline services. Written in C++ 17 with an `extern "C"` API, The DeepStream Services Library (DSL) can be called from both C/C++ and Python applications.

## Examples

### C++

```C++
#include <DslApi.h>

// New V4L2 Source
uint retval = dsl_source_v4l2_new(L"my-web-cam-1", L"/dev/video0");
```

### Python3

```Python
from dsl import *

# New V4L2 Source
retval = dsl_source_v4l2_new('my-web-cam-1', '/dev/video0')
```

DSL is built on the NVIDIA® [DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk), _"A complete streaming analytics toolkit for AI-based video and image understanding, as well as multi-sensor processing."_,

The DeepStream SDK and DSL use the open source [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/),  _"An extremely powerful and versatile framework for creating streaming media applications"_.

## Important Bulletins
The latest `v0.28.alpha` release was developed to support DeepSteam 6.3 and 6.4. However, there are several critical NVIDIA bugs that affect DSL's behavior. We are currently waiting on an ETA for a new DeepStream release (hopefully for NVIDIA GTC 2024 | March 18–21). Issues include:
1. [Pipelines with new `nvstreammux` and `nvstreamdemux` fail to play correctly in DS 6.3](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pipelines-with-new-nvstreammux-and-nvstreamdemux-fail-to-play-correctly-in-ds-6-3/278396/5)
2. [Unable to record with deepstream-testsr example on Jetson Orin Nano with DeepStream 6.4](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/unable-to-record-with-deepstream-testsr-example-on-jetson-orin-nano-with-deepstream-6-4/279778)
3. [Pipelines with jpegenc and multifilesink produce invalid jpeg files in DS 6.4](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pipelines-with-jpegenc-and-multifilesink-produce-invalid-jpeg-files-in-ds-6-4/280216)
4. [DeepStream can’t decode certain H265 streams properly](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/deepstream-cant-decode-certain-h265-streams-properly/276027)
5. There are other New nvstreammux issues that still need to be reported.

### _IMPORANT! There are breaking changes in the most recent release. Please read the [Release Notes](/Release%20Notes/v0.28.alpha.md) carefully._
